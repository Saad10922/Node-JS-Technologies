Code Breakdown:
Importing the 'fs' module: The fs module in Node.js is used to interact with the file system. The line const fs = require('fs'); imports this module so you can use its functions.

javascript

Copy
const fs = require('fs');
Reading a file: The fs.readFile function reads the contents of a file. It takes three arguments:

The path to the file (example.txt in this case).

The encoding type ('utf8' means it will read the file as a string).

A callback function that gets called after the file is read.

Callback function: This function is executed once fs.readFile has finished reading the file. It has two parameters:

err: This will contain any error that occurred while reading the file. If there's no error, it will be null.

data: This will contain the contents of the file.

Handling errors: If an error occurs (e.g., the file doesn't exist), it will be thrown and the program will stop running.

javascript

Copy
if (err) throw err;
Printing the file contents: If there are no errors, the contents of the file are printed to the console.

javascript

Copy
console.log(data);
Full Code with Comments:
javascript

Copy
// Import the 'fs' module
const fs = require('fs');

// Read the contents of 'example.txt'
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    // If there's an error, throw it
    if (err) throw err;
    // If no error, log the file contents
    console.log(data);
});
In simple terms, this code reads the content of a file named example.txt and prints it to the console. If there's any error in reading the file, it will stop the execution and display the error.
